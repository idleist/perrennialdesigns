# Perrennial Designs Website

I have been messing around with node.js for a while and completing tutorials, but this is my first attempt at a full website from scratch.
It is a basic, clean design for a fictional gardening company.  My aim was to integrate a mongoDB database and provide a basic CMS for a client.
Services such as wordpress are great, but many clients only want to have control over limited elements on their sites.  This website allows
the client to add or remove any new testimonials for their work and any projects they want to show on the site.

This site is by no means a production ready site.  In production there would not be a BIG RED admin button.  There would be a hidden /admin
url for the owner of the site to access the admin functionality (with a login).  This is just a practice site for me.
